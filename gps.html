    <div class="panel-body">
        Previously, we hosted our own GPS server (powered by <a href="https://www.traccar.org/">Traccar</a>) 
        as a fun project to voluntarily share and track the locations of our members.
        <br>
        <br>
        Due to issues with server stability and upkeep, this service is <u>no longer active</u> as of 2018-10-27.

        All data has been archived and can be extracted if requested.
