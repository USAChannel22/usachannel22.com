        <b>USA Channel 22</b> is in the process of setting up various Pavlov VR servers for the community. All of our servers are marked with [Ch22].<br>
        <br>
        Currently, the only server is the testing server.<br>
        <br>
        To contact us reguarding this server, look for Dylan Madigan (Ch22 Network Administrator) on the <a href="https://usachannel22.com/discord.html">USA Channel 22 Discord</a> or <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/pavlov-vr">The Pavlov VR Discord</a>.<br>

    <b>Testing Server</b><br>
    <br>
    Incase people are too ******* stupid to connect the dots, the testing server is for testing.<br>
    <br>
    You are still welcome to join the server, infact more people is often more helpful, but if something specific is being tested please do not interupt it.

<div class="panel panel-default panel-body">
    <b>Call of Duty Server</b><br>
    <br>
    Incase people are too ******* stupid to connect the dots, this server uses Call of Duty maps.<br>
    <br>
    The idea is any and every (working) CoD map will be in the rotations here. For most, VR is a new experiance, but VR on a map we all already know and love is a whole new experiance in of it's self. At the time this is written, we currently have 17 maps lined up for rotation, from Cod 2, World at War, Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops, Black ops 2, and Infinite Warfare.<br>
    <br>
    These maps are remade or converted in by other talented members of the Pavlov VR community
