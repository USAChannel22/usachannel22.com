		Donations on <a href="https://Patreon.com/USAChannel22">Patreon</a> for Base 2 go to Dylan for server and network operations.<br>
		<br>
		It is important to us to say thank you for any support, every little bit helps to keep our systems running and growing, but it is more important to us to keep games fair and balanced. Below is a list of donator perks, many of which should be enjoyable, but none of which should create an unfair situation for non-donators.<br>
		<br>
		PLEASE be sure to contact Dylan or the relivant administrators when you donate, so that we can associate your donation with your usernames.

		These servers require time and dedication to run and manage, but it does not just stop there. We thank the entire administration team for their hard work and commitment to our community, including the moderators upholding rules, the administrators running the game servers, and the administrators physically maintaining a network that spans the globe.<br>
		<br>
		While USA Channel 22 may be mostly American, it is made up of members from around the world. Many of whom are gamers, some hobbiests, some professionals, who all share one thing in common: Mild autism.
