		Donations on <a href="https://Patreon.com/USAChannel22">Patreon</a> for Base 2 go to Dylan for server and network operations.<br>
		<br>
		It is important to us to say thank you for any support, every little bit helps to keep our systems running and growing, but it is more important to us to keep games fair and balanced. Below is a list of donator perks, many of which should be enjoyable, but none of which should create an unfair situation for non-donators.<br>
		<br>
		PLEASE be sure to contact Dylan or the relivant administrators when you donate, so that we can associate your donation with your usernames.
